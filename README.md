# Yupi [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Anadea/yupi.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/Anadea/yupi)

Yupi is the base Rails application used at
[anadea](http://anadea.info).

  ![Yupi juice](http://www.dismarex.com.ec/pro/img/YUPI.jpg)

## Installation

First install the yupi gem:

    gem install yupi

Then run:

    yupi projectname

This will create a Rails app in `projectname` using the latest version of Rails.

## Gemfile

To see the latest and greatest gems, look at Yupi'
[Gemfile](templates/Gemfile.erb), which will be appended to the default
generated projectname/Gemfile.

## Dependencies

Yupi requires the latest version of Ruby.

Some gems included in Yupi have native extensions. You should have GCC
installed on your machine before generating an app with Yupi.

Use [OS X GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/) for
Snow Leopard (OS X 10.6).

Use [Command Line Tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action)
for Lion (OS X 10.7) or Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8).

We use [Poltergeist](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist) for
full-stack JavaScript integration testing. It requires PhantomJS. Instructions for
installing it are
[here](https://github.com/teampoltergeist/poltergeist#installing-phantomjs).

PostgreSQL needs to be installed and running for the `db:create` rake task.
